# Important

This project is a photo library but isn't intended to be used by thousands of users or store thousands of photos.
This is just a personal project made. DO NOT store important photos or any important information here that you do not have backed up, it may get deleted.

## Built using Firebase and React

I built this project using create-react-app and I am utilizing many different things firebase has to offer such as their
authentication, storage, and even their realtime database to save the data being inputted.

## Project use

You can use this project to save your photos. You can add a little caption to the photo as well.
You can delete the image whenever you would like to as well as upload different images at your convenience.

This is being used with firebase's free data plan so there is a limit on storage and photos will get deleted.

## How to start

Clone the repository, install all necessities in order to run react on your local machine, use your own firebase credentials, and run the application.
You might need a small amount of knowledge of firebase in order to get this working.

## Why this was built

This was built as a project that I wanted to dive into authentication, database, storage, etc and this is a project I came up with in order to test all of that.
All of these functionalities were possible with the use of firebase.
