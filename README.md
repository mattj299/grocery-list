in order to create real readme just look at photo-library readme then alter for this one

AFTER COMPLETELY DONE WITH SITE

go back to MERN stack application and change the loading. looks stupid and unprofessional when saying 'either loading or no posts'
figure out how to either have it loading or have no posts separately not together

create one advertising your "personal training" or "nutrition" whatever you want or both but something about you or sometihng that's actually fucking useful and not just little projects that don't necessarily do anything for you but simply add projects to your fucking repository which look like shit btw just wanted to add that.

IDEA

go on dribble and copy a design for your own site first just copy the straight design as well as word for word and color for color but once done
take a design and make a website yourself but using only their design
